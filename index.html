                Littering a dark and dreary road<br>
                lay the past relics of browser-<br>
                specific tags, incompatable<br>
                DOMs, and broken CSS<br>
                support.Today, we must clear<br>
                the mind of past practices. Web<br>
                enlightenment has been <br>
                achieved thanks to the tireless<br>
                efforts of folk like the W3C,<br>
                WaSP and the major browser<br>
                creators.<br>
                The css zen Garden invites you <br>
                to relax and meditate on the <br>
                important lessons of the <br>
                clarity. Learn to use the (yet to<br>
                 be) time-honored techniques in <br>
                 new and invigorating fashion.<br>

            There is clearly a need for CSS<br>
            to be taken seriously by graphic<br>
            artists. The Zem Garden aims to <br>
            excite, inspire, and encourage<br>
            participation. To begin, view<br>
            sime of the existing designs in <br>
            the list.The code remains the <br>
            same, the only thing that has<br>
            changed is the external .css file.<br>
            Yes, really.<br>
            CSS allows complete and total<br>
            control over the style of a <br>
            hypertext document. The only <br>
            way this can be illustrated in a<br>
            way that gets people excited is <br>
            by demonstrating what it can <br>
            truly be, once the reins are<br>
            placed in the hands of those<br>
            able to create beauty from<br>
            strucuture.To date, most<br>
            examples of neat tricks and <br>
            hacks have been demonstrated<br>
            by structurists and coders.<br>
            Designers have yet to make<br>
            their mark. This needs to <br>
            change.
